CoronaChatter is built to unify people during this time of social distancing. Users can register and subscribe to topics they are interested in. Users can post their own stories or comment on already existing posts. After subscribing to topics, the user is offered a feed of posts containing only posts from topics they are interested in.

Backend has NodeJS, GraphQl and Express.js as its backbone. Frontend is built using Bootstrap 4 and jQuery.
